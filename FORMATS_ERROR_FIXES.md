# 🔧 Formats Endpoint Error Fixes

## ❌ Original Issue:
**"Failed to fetch formats: 500 Internal Server Error"**
- Server was crashing due to "Cannot set headers after they are sent" error
- FFmpeg streaming code was trying to set progress headers after response started
- Server crashed and became unresponsive

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Fixed Headers Already Sent Error**
- ✅ Added `!res.headersSent` checks before setting headers
- ✅ Wrapped header setting in try-catch blocks
- ✅ Fixed both progressive and adaptive streaming functions
- ✅ Server no longer crashes when setting progress headers

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- ✅ Better URL validation with try-catch blocks  
- ✅ Specific error messages for different scenarios:
  - Video unavailable/removed
  - Private videos
  - Age-restricted content
  - Copyright restrictions
  - Network connection errors
- ✅ Development mode error details for debugging

### 3. **Improved Logging**
- ✅ Added detailed console logging for format fetching
- ✅ Success/error logging with context information
- ✅ Better debugging information for troubleshooting

### 4. **Streaming Safety**
- ✅ Multiple fallback mechanisms for header setting
- ✅ Graceful error handling that doesn't crash the server
- ✅ Better FFmpeg progress tracking
- ✅ Safe response handling throughout the pipeline

## 🚀 Technical Details:

### Fixed Code Locations:
1. **`server/services/streamingDownloader.js`**:
   - Line 110: Fixed progressive streaming header setting
   - Line 164: Fixed FFmpeg progress header setting
   - Lines 87-99: Enhanced error handling in getBestFormats

2. **`server/routes/streaming.js`**:
   - Lines 16-22: Enhanced URL validation
   - Lines 47-53: Added validation to formats endpoint
   - Lines 173-194: Comprehensive error response handling

### Error Prevention:
- **Headers Check**: Always verify `!res.headersSent` before setting headers
- **Try-Catch Wrapping**: All header operations wrapped in try-catch
- **Specific Error Messages**: User-friendly error descriptions
- **Server Stability**: No more crashes due to header conflicts

## 🟢 Current Status:
- **Server**: ✅ Running stable without crashes
- **Formats Endpoint**: ✅ Properly handling all requests
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Graceful error responses
- **Streaming**: ✅ Safe header management
- **Debugging**: ✅ Comprehensive logging

The formats endpoint should now work correctly without 500 errors!
