# 🎵🎬 Audio & Video Streaming Fixes

## ❌ Original Issues:
1. **Audio Not Supported** - Downloaded videos had no audio
2. **Video Continuously Buffering** - Video preview kept loading, couldn't seek properly
3. **Static Video Issue** - Video wasn't seekable, appeared to be streaming continuously

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Fixed Audio Support**
- ✅ **Progressive Format Priority**: Now prioritizes formats that include both video + audio
- ✅ **FFmpeg Audio Merging**: Improved audio/video merging with proper AAC encoding
- ✅ **Audio Headers**: Added `X-Audio-Included` headers to indicate successful audio merging
- ✅ **Better Codec Settings**: 
  - Video: Copy stream (no re-encoding for speed)
  - Audio: Re-encode to AAC 128kbps for universal compatibility

### 2. **Fixed Video Seeking & Playback**
- ✅ **Progressive Sources**: Video preview now uses progressive formats (complete files) instead of adaptive
- ✅ **Quality Limitation**: Limited preview to 720p for better streaming performance
- ✅ **Fallback Chain**: Multiple sources from progressive → adaptive → fallback
- ✅ **Proper Preloading**: Set video preload to "metadata" for faster seeking

### 3. **Enhanced Video Element**
- ✅ **Better Event Handlers**: Added comprehensive video event tracking
- ✅ **Seeking Support**: Added `onTimeUpdate`, `onSeeked` for proper seeking
- ✅ **Buffering Detection**: Added `onWaiting`, `onPlaying` to detect buffering states
- ✅ **Cross-Origin Support**: Added CORS headers for better streaming compatibility

### 4. **Improved FFmpeg Configuration**
- ✅ **Fixed Timestamp Issues**: Added `-avoid_negative_ts make_zero` and `-fflags +genpts`
- ✅ **Better Streaming Flags**: Enhanced `-movflags` for proper MP4 streaming
- ✅ **Audio Quality**: Set consistent 128k audio bitrate
- ✅ **Error Logging**: Detailed logging for audio/video merge process
